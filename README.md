Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Signe!

I am a software developer looking to expand my knowledge and create many interesting and challenging projects.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Flight-Planner project using Spring Boot Framework.
    
ðŸŒ± I am also working on a planner project with Angular. Beginning to learn HTML and CSS, and refreshing my knowledge of TypeScript.

   Iâ€™m also learning Java, particularly Spring Boot and how to implement databases. 

Down below you can see the projects I am currently working on.
